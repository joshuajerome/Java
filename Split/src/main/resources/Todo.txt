Each user has say "n" transactions in their transactionHistory
A users transaction history will store ALL transactions regardless of Event/Trip associated with it

But within each event, there will be a map of users roughly like so:

      In an event (Friday Dinner):

      members = Josh, Gautam, Suvass

      Map in event:

      Josh    -->   Gautam:   x
                    Suvass:   x

      Gautam  -->   Josh:     x
                    Suvass:   x

      Suvass  -->   Josh:     x
                    Gautam:   x

But within Josh's total transaction history, it will look like:

      Josh  -->   Gautam:   x
                  Suvass:   x
                  Chris:    x
                  ...

The member map in event should only be able to access and store the 
transactions associated with said event.

How do I do this?

**

Transaction record an object

tHistory is a set: value as record: sender/receiver, date, time, amount, message
generated by transaction manager 
transaction manager interacts with sender reciever, puts a record in each user's transaction history

User should only have identification and fields

seperate class for contacts

seperate class called transactionHistoryManager
map of User id, user's transaction history
have a toString()

Account and Account Manager class
Account can either be Zelle, PayPal, Venmo etc.
Has a balance var, getBalance(), desposit, withdraw

Account Manager:
associates a user with an Account
uuid as id
maintains map: user id, user's account


Expense Manager class that handles everything

***** 
Add toString() to each class
