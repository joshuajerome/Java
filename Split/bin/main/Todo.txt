Each user has say "n" transactions in their transactionHistory
A users transaction history will store ALL transactions regardless of Event/Trip associated with it

But within each event, there will be a map of users roughly like so:

      In an event (Friday Dinner):

      members = Josh, Gautam, Suvass

      Map in event:

      Josh    -->   Gautam:   x
                    Suvass:   x

      Gautam  -->   Josh:     x
                    Suvass:   x

      Suvass  -->   Josh:     x
                    Gautam:   x

But within Josh's total transaction history, it will look like:

      Josh  -->   Gautam:   x
                  Suvass:   x
                  Chris:    x
                  ...

The member map in event should only be able to access and store the 
transactions associated with said event.

How do I do this?

***** 
Add toString() to each class

***** 03/23/23
Account:    
AccountManager:
Calculator:
Contacts:
ContactsManager:
Databse:
Event:
EventManager:
Expense:
ExpenseManager:
Transaction: Complete
TransactionRecord: Complete
TransactionHistory: 
TransactionHistoryManager:
TransactionManager:
Trip:
User:
UserManager

- Identify which maps/vars should be static.
- Create a high level class which has all managers and functions for the tests run in main 

- Develop Contacts/ContactsManager, Account/AccountManager, UserManager
- Trip/Event and incorporation of expense/ExpenseManager

Suvass & Raghav:

Optimize Calculator class. Curently we have generateSubArrays() and optimize() which are two seperate functions
that work sequentially to return the desired split of sub arrays. It appears that the solution is superficially
recursive, so try to combine these functions into one recursive function. Then translate this recurive function
into an iterative function.
