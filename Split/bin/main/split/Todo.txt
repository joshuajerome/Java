Should transactions be between two people or multiple people?

It makes sense for transactions to be soley between two people. 
- In events/trips, the act of requesting is to a group of people, but each person pays their own dues individually.
  Hence, each person has their own unique transaction with an admin.

REQUESTs: should be solely a tranasction message + amount. I don't think this should affect the balances of each user.
SENDs: should affect the balance of only the person recieveing money. Potential API call for venmo or whatever.

SETTLEs: is this necessary? Is the same thing as SEND except it invokes the API call for you i guess?
IGNOREs: Each user should be able to waive off a request. 

Transact class should be called within Events.
Should each user have an expenseManager class where it does the transaction balance functions? - this solves the cluttering issue of User
Each user should be able to put a certain balance for themselves which is unique to an event.

TripManager class to accumulate the balances associated with each User into one big summary.
